### Xin ch√†o! 

My name is The-Huan, although I also go by Huan or Shaun, depending on where in the world you see me. Hailing from Vietnam, I have lived, studied, and worked in many countries like the United States, Argentina, Denmark, Italy, and Singapore. Most recently though, I can be found thrift-shopping in London.

I am an economist by training with a long stint in the Marketing Tech industry. While on the job, I was fascinated by the power of big data and the cloud. Marrying that with my love for maps and the desire to see more of the world in ways I have not been to previously, I decided to embark on a journey into Remote Sensing and Earth Observation.

I also love talking about (and in) foreign languages that I know and am learning. Currently working on German and Mandarin.
