### Xin ch√†o!

My name is The-Huan, although I also go by Huan or Shaun, depending on where in the world you see me.

Hailing from Vietnam, I have lived, studied, and worked in many countries like the United States, Argentina, Denmark, Italy, and Singapore. Most recently, though, I can be found looking at maps and thrift-shopping in London.

I am an economist by training with a long subsequent stint in the Tech industry. While on the job, I was fascinated by the power of "Big Data" and the cloud. Marrying that with the love for maps and earth observation, I embarked on this journey into Remote Sensing. Come on in.

I also love talking about (and in) foreign languages I know and am learning. Say hi to me in Vietnamese, English, Spanish, and Italian. Currently working on German and Mandarin.
