### Hello!

My name is The-Huan, although I also go by Huan or Shaun, depending on where in the world you see me. Hailing from Vietnam, I have lived, studied, and worked in many countries. Most recently though, I can be found thrift-shopping in London.

As if it was not enough, I wanted to see more of the world in ways I have not been to previously. So this is it, a learning diary about my journey venturing into Remote Sensing and Earth Observation.

I love talking about languages, travel, data science, maps, trains, and music. Hopefully, I can add Remote Sensing to this list by the end of this.
