# Entering the World of Remote Sensing

Remote Sensing is the use of satellites, planes, drones, etc. as our aerial eyes, piecing together a portrait of our planet through light and data and revolutionising the way we understand and interact with it.

## In a few words...

Sensors, well, 'sense' Earth in two ways: Some passively listen to sunlight reflected off our planet's surface (i.e., *passive sensors*), while others actively send their own signals and capture the echoes (i.e., *active sensors*). By that definition, the human eye is a type of passive sensors!

These sensors interpret a fascinating language of light, both invisible and visible, known as the *electromagnetic spectrum.*

Electromagnetic radiation moves as waves as perpendicular electric and magnetic field with a wavelength: `λ = c/v` where:

-   `λ` = **wavelength**, distance between two crests

-   `c` = velocity of light 3 x 10^8^ m/sec

-   `v` = frequency, rate of oscillation (full oscillations in a time unit)

Different materials reflect unique wavelengths in this spectrum, allowing us to identify them, like decoding DNA! More on this later...

But information that sensors receive isn't just about color. Remote sensing data has its own "resolution" recipe, encompassing:

-   **Spectral:** How EMS bands (i.e., the range within the EMS) the sensor can hear, revealing more detail with each additional band.
-   **Spatial:** The size of each pixel in the image, ranging from centimeters to kilometers, offering varying levels of detail.
-   **Temporal:** How often the sensor revisits the same area, providing a dynamic view of changes over time.
-   **Radiometric:** The range of brightness levels captured, painting a vibrant and accurate picture.

In reality, depending on the purpose, each sensor is equip to have better resolution of one type over the other. For example, sensors with a high spatial resolution of 5m (i.e., each pixel is 10x10 on the ground) will have lower spectral resolution (i.e., capturing only narrow range of the EMS) [@RemoteSensingSatellite]

## Applications

Now, let's delve into the transformative applications of remote sensing, especially in the realm of Urban Analytics. Think of it as an X-ray for cities, revealing hidden patterns and empowering informed decision-making by city planners, urban designers, and public officials to make swift and informed decisions to improve the lives of millions of urban residents.

The applications of remote sensing in urban analytics are endless. Here are some examples

1.  **Mapping Urban Growth:** By tracking changes in the built environment over time, we can identify sprawling suburbs, monitor urban expansion, and plan for infrastructure needs.

2.  **Predicting Floods with Foresight:** Analysing land cover and terrain, it anticipates where water will flow, safeguarding communities from harm.

3.  **Energy Efficiency Champion:** Identifying heat island effects and understanding building energy consumption through thermal imaging empowers planners to design sustainable cities

This is just the beginning. Remote sensing is transforming the way we understand and manage our cities, paving the way for a healthier, smarter, and more sustainable urban future.

## Reflections

My first foray into this world was both humbling and exhilarating. Processing vast amounts of data, juggling resolutions, and diving into the electromagnetic spectrum symphony - it was a challenging yet rewarding journey. Every step felt like decoding a new secret, like learning a new language of our planet.

Working with satellite imagery was unlike anything I'd experienced before. It shifted my perspective from high-resolution photographs to spectral dances, where each pixel held a universe of information. Building a true-color composite from RGB bands, analysing plots in Cape Town, and unraveling the spectral signatures - it was like seeing the world through a brand-new lens.

This journey ignited a spark of curiosity that burns brighter with each step. I'm eager to delve deeper into advanced platforms like Google Earth Engine, explore the intricate web of policy applications, and unlock the true potential of this technology for the betterment of our planet.

Join me on this thrilling expedition! Together, let's paint a new picture of our planet, pixel by pixel, and use remote sensing to write a better story for our shared future.
