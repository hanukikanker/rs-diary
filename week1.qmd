# Entering the World of Remote Sensing

Remote Sensing is the use of satellites, planes, drones, etc. as our aerial eyes, piecing together a portrait of our planet through light and data and revolutionising the way we understand and interact with it.

## In a few words...

Sensors, well, 'sense' Earth in two ways: Some passively listen to sunlight reflected off our planet's surface (i.e., *passive sensors*), while others actively send their own signals and capture the echoes (i.e., *active sensors*). By that definition, the human eye is a type of passive sensors!

These sensors interpret a fascinating language of light, both invisible and visible, known as the *electromagnetic spectrum.*

Electromagnetic radiation moves as waves as perpendicular electric and magnetic field with a wavelength: `λ = c/v` where:

-   `λ` = **wavelength**, distance between two crests

-   `c` = velocity of light 3 x 10^8^ m/sec

-   `v` = frequency, rate of oscillation (full oscillations in a time unit)

Different materials reflect unique wavelengths in this spectrum, allowing us to identify them, like decoding DNA! More on this later...

But information that sensors receive isn't just about color. Remote sensing data has its own "resolution" recipe, encompassing:

-   **Spectral:** How EMS bands (i.e., the range within the EMS) the sensor can hear, revealing more detail with each additional band.
-   **Spatial:** The size of each pixel in the image, ranging from centimeters to kilometers, offering varying levels of detail.
-   **Temporal:** How often the sensor revisits the same area, providing a dynamic view of changes over time.
-   **Radiometric:** The range of brightness levels captured, painting a vibrant and accurate picture.

In reality, depending on the purpose, each sensor is equip to have better resolution of one type over the other. For example, sensors with a high spatial resolution of 5m (i.e., each pixel is 10x10 on the ground) will have lower spectral resolution (i.e., capturing only narrow range of the EMS) [@RemoteSensingSatellite]

## Applications

Remote Sensing has many transformative applications in the realm of Urban Analytics. Think of it as an X-ray for cities, revealing hidden patterns and empowering informed decision-making by city planners, urban designers, and public officials to make swift and informed decisions to improve the lives of millions of urbanites.

Here are some examples

1.  **Mapping Urban Growth:** By tracking changes in the built environment over time, we can identify sprawling suburbs, monitor urban expansion, and plan for infrastructure needs.

2.  **Predicting Floods with Foresight:** Analysing land cover and terrain, it anticipates where water will flow, safeguarding communities from harm.

3.  **Energy Efficiency:** Identifying heat island effects and understanding building energy consumption through thermal imaging empowers planners to design sustainable cities

This is just the beginning. Remote sensing is transforming the way we understand and manage our cities, paving the way for a healthier, smarter, and more sustainable urban future.

## Reflections

My first foray into the world of Remote Sensing was eye-opening, to say the least. For the uninitiated, it is easy to assume that remote sensing purely means orthophotographic satellite images that one might see using platforms such as Google Maps, i.e., as if the only thing that sensors do were to snap a simple photo of the planet like a phone camera.

In reality, it unlocks unseen depths of data beyond mere human perception, less high-resolution photographs and more spectral signatures, where each pixel holds a universe of information. Building a true-color composite from all these layers (so that our eyes can see) was like seeing the world through a brand-new lens.

I am particularly excited to get started with Google Earth Engine later on as the primary gateway to access the wealth of remote sensing data and analytics with more ease in order to solve specific problems facing our world today.
