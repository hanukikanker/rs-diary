# Glossary {.unnumbered}

## **Basic::**

-   **Active Sensor:** A remote sensing system that transmits its own energy (e.g., radio waves, light) towards the target and records the reflected or scattered radiation.

-   **Albedo:** The proportion of electromagnetic radiation reflected by a surface.

-   **Amplitude Data:** In SAR imagery, refers to the strength of the reflected signal, used to distinguish between different land cover types based on their varying reflectivity properties.

-   **Anisotropy:** Variation in reflectance depending on viewing angle.

-   **Azimuth:** Horizontal direction of an object relative to an observer (degrees from north).

-   **Biosignature:** Spectral signature indicative of biological activity.

-   **DEM (Digital Elevation Model):** Digital representation of terrain elevation.

-   **Geometric Correction:** Correcting distortions in image geometry.

-   **Incidence Angle:** The angle at which radiation strikes a surface.

-   **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging):** Remote sensing technique using lasers to measure distance.

-   **Nadir:** The point directly below an observer, on the opposite side of the Earth.

-   **Passive Sensor:** A remote sensing system that detects the naturally occurring energy emitted (from the sun) or reflected from the Earth's surface and atmosphere.

-   **Phase Data:** In SAR imagery, refers to the information about the relative timing of the received signal compared to the transmitted signal, used to generate information about the surface features.

-   **Radiance:** Total electromagnetic energy emitted per unit area, solid angle, and time.

-   **Reflectance:** The proportion of electromagnetic radiation reflected by a surface.

-   **Resolution:**

    -   **Spatial:** Size of an area represented by a single pixel.

    -   **Spectral:** Number and width of wavelength bands used in an image.

    -   **Temporal:** Frequency with which an area is revisited by a satellite sensor.

-   **Sensor:** A device that detects and measures electromagnetic radiation.

-   **Spectral Band:** A specific range of wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum.

-   **Spectral Reflectance:** The proportion of electromagnetic radiation reflected by a surface at different wavelengths.

-   **Spectral Signature:** The unique way an object reflects or emits radiation across different wavelengths.

-   **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR):** A type of radar that creates high-resolution images by processing reflected signals.

-   **Zenith Angle:** The angle between the vertical direction and a point in the sky.

## **Pre-processing:**

-   **Calibration:** Correcting for systematic errors in satellite imagery.

-   **Radiometric Correction:** Correcting for variations in sensor response and atmospheric effects.

-   **Geometric Correction:** Correcting distortions in image geometry caused by sensor perspective and Earth's curvature.

-   **Atmospheric Correction:** Correcting for the effects of atmospheric gases and aerosols on the spectral signature of objects in an image.

-   **Contrast Stretching:** Enhancing the visual contrast between features in an image.

-   **Filtering:** Techniques for manipulating and enhancing image data based on specific criteria (e.g., spatial filtering to sharpen edges, spectral filtering to isolate specific wavelengths).

-   **Band Indices:** Mathematical transformations of spectral bands used to highlight specific features (e.g., NDVI for vegetation health).

-   **Data Fusion:** Combining data from multiple sources (e.g., satellite imagery, LiDAR) for more comprehensive analysis.

## **Analysis:**

-   **Classification:** Assigning categories (e.g., forest, water) to pixels in an image based on their spectral characteristics.

-   **Clustering:** Grouping pixels with similar spectral characteristics together without predefined classes.

-   **Change Detection:** Identifying and analyzing modifications in land cover or features over time using multi-temporal imagery.

-   **Image Classification:** The process of assigning pixels or objects to categories (e.g., LULC)

-   **Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA):** Analyzing imagery based on segmented objects rather than individual pixels, allowing for incorporation of shape and spatial relationships.

-   **SLIC (Superpixels Lattice Segmentation):** A segmentation algorithm used to divide an image into smaller, more uniform regions called superpixels.

-   **Spatial Autocorrelation:** The degree to which the values at one location in a spatial dataset are statistically related to the values at neighboring locations.

-   **Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA):** Estimating the fractional abundance of different materials within a pixel based on their spectral signatures.
