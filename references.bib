  abstract = {Vitoria-Gasteiz has taken several urban greening actions such as the introduction of a ring of parks that connect the city’s surroundings, a sustainable mobility plan, and urban green structure strategies. Previous studies establish a connection to the importance of greening to mitigate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and evaluate the effectiveness of these measures on urban climate. In this study, land surface temperature (LST), a remote sensing (RS) parameter, recorded by Landsat satellites (5, 7, and 8) was used to evaluate the effect of SUHI in Vitoria-Gasteiz between 1985–2021. The aim was to evaluate whether the urban greening actions influenced the local thermal conditions and, consequently, helped minimize the SUHI. Thirty sampling locations were identified, corresponding to different local climate zones (LCZ), at which LST data were extracted. A total of 218 images were processed and separated into summer and winter. Four of the 30 locations had, since 2003, on-site meteorological stations with regular air temperature (Tair) measurements which were used to validate the LST data. The results showed that Spearman’s correlation between Tair and LST was higher than 0.88 in all locations. An amount of 21 points maintained the same LCZ classification throughout the analysed period and nine underwent a LCZ transformation. The highest average temperature was identified in the city centre (urbanized area), and the lowest average was in a forest on the outskirts of the city. SUHI was more intense during the summer. A significant increase in SUHI intensity was identified in areas transformed from natural to urban LCZs. However, SUHI during satellite data acquisition periods has shown a minimal change in areas where sustainable practices have been implemented. RS was valuable for analysing the thermal behaviour of the LCZs, despite the limitation inherent in the satellite’s time of passage, in which the SUHI effect is not as evident.},

  abstract = {Google Street View (GSV) presents the world as fact, mapped and documented, and reconstituted online: an approximation of the street condition. Google’s fleet takes the built environment as its territory, renders it photographically, and maps it spatially. GSV’s comprehensive coverage makes it useful for daily navigational needs, and its diverse mapped terrain encourages user innovation, experimentation, and exploration. As a spatial representation, it brings together two distinct ways of knowing the world through empirical documentation: mapping and photography. Whereas maps offer visual diagrams of spatial information, photographs offer documents with spatiotemporal specificity. Together, the spatialized image becomes the mode of navigation and exploration. This article draws on the embodied subject, wayfinding, and perception in relation to spatial knowledge formation to consider GSV’s ability to alter existing daily practices. Rather than the sensorial rich primary experience of moving through the world, the visually rich secondary experiences via GSV come to inform our navigation and exploration through image recognition. This article argues that the platform’s spatialized image and efficient technological layer produces a shift from the embodied experience of place to the image as experience.},

  abstract = {The application of machine learning (ML) in a range of geospatial tasks is increasingly common but often relies on globally available covariates such as satellite imagery that can either be expensive or lack predictive power. Here we explore the question of whether the vast amounts of knowledge found in Internet language corpora, now compressed within large language models (LLMs), can be leveraged for geospatial prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that LLMs embed remarkable spatial information about locations, but naively querying LLMs using geographic coordinates alone is ineffective in predicting key indicators like population density. We then present GeoLLM, a novel method that can effectively extract geospatial knowledge from LLMs with auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap. We demonstrate the utility of our approach across multiple tasks of central interest to the international community, including the measurement of population density and economic livelihoods. Across these tasks, our method demonstrates a 70\% improvement in performance (measured using Pearson's \$r\^2\$) relative to baselines that use nearest neighbors or use information directly from the prompt, and performance equal to or exceeding satellite-based benchmarks in the literature. With GeoLLM, we observe that GPT-3.5 outperforms Llama 2 and RoBERTa by 19\% and 51\% respectively, suggesting that the performance of our method scales well with the size of the model and its pretraining dataset. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are remarkably sample-efficient, rich in geospatial information, and robust across the globe. Crucially, GeoLLM shows promise in mitigating the limitations of existing geospatial covariates and complementing them well.},

  abstract = {Geocomputation and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) have essential roles in advancing geographic information science (GIS) and Earth observation to a new stage. GeoAI has enhanced traditional geospatial analysis and mapping, altering the methods for understanding and managing complex human–natural systems. However, there are still challenges in various aspects of geospatial applications related to natural, built, and social environments, and in integrating unique geospatial features into GeoAI models. Meanwhile, geospatial and Earth data are critical components in geocomputation and GeoAI studies, as they can effectively reveal geospatial patterns, factors, relationships, and decision-making processes. This editorial provides a comprehensive overview of geocomputation and GeoAI applications in mapping, classifying them into four categories: (i) buildings and infrastructure, (ii) land use analysis, (iii) natural environment and hazards, and (iv) social issues and human activities. In addition, the editorial summarizes geospatial and Earth data in case studies into seven categories, including in-situ data, geospatial datasets, crowdsourced geospatial data (i.e., geospatial big data), remote sensing data, photogrammetry data, LiDAR, and statistical data. Finally, the editorial presents challenges and opportunities for future research.},

  abstract = {Analysis of built-up areas—the most significant artificial urban areas—reveals physical development processes. Unlike previous research involving medium-resolution remote sensing (RS) images, this study used built-up area maps generated from multiple high-resolution RS images with abundant built-up area edge information to analyze development in Zhengzhou. A transferable built-up area extraction (TBUAE) algorithm was developed to map the built-up area maps. The algorithm allows the developed deep learning model used on a certain satellite image to be eligible for other types of satellite images by altering the data distribution with adaptive Wallis filtering (DT-AWF). The proposed method alleviates the pressure of deep learning on the demand for new satellite image samples that are time-consuming and laborious. Additionally, the accuracy of built-up area mapping using this method exceeds 90\%. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted on the map results to observe the urban development of Zhengzhou from 2016 to 2020. We found that Zhengzhou has expanded rapidly since it was defined as a central city in central China in 2016. Additionally, the suburban built-up area has expanded rapidly and developed together with the central city. Further, affected by the policy, the built-up areas in different regions of Zhengzhou has changed differently, the urban edge is more simplified, and the urban internal structure is more compact.},
