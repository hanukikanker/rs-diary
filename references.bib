  abstract = {Climate change mitigation efforts to achieve net-zero emissions require not only decreasing current greenhouse gas emissions, but also the deployment of negative emissions technologies. Soil organic carbon sequestration in agricultural lands is one such negative emissions strategy, currently being incentivized predominantly through voluntary carbon offset markets. Through semi-structured interviews, we assess both conventional and organic farmer perspectives on soil carbon offset programs that have been created in the United States since 2017. The perspectives of farmers both participating and not participating in agricultural soil carbon markets were similar and consistent. Farmers in both groups expressed concerns about the convoluted, burdensome and unpredictable nature of receiving offset credits and emphasized that they were implementing practices for their own business interests and sustainability concerns, not the financial incentive of the generation of carbon credits. Based on our research, carbon offset credit payments for agricultural soil carbon sequestration are largely reaching farmers who were already implementing these beneficial practices or were already strongly interested in implementing these practices, and the payments for the offset credits are seen as a ‘gravy on top’, suggesting that these offset markets face strong challenges of ensuring true additionality essential to effective climate mitigation.},

  abstract = {Cloud detection in optical remote sensing images is a crucial problem because undetected clouds can produce misleading results in the analyses of surface and atmospheric parameters. Sentinel-2 provides high spatial resolution satellite data distributed with associated cloud masks. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of Sentinel-2 Level-1C cloud mask products to discriminate clouds over a variety of biogeographic scenarios and in different cloudiness conditions. Reference cloud masks for the identification of misdetection were generated by applying a local thresholding method that analyses Sentinel-2 Band 2 (0.490\,μm) and Band 10 (1.375\,μm) separately; histogram-based thresholds were locally tuned by checking the single bands and the natural color composite (B4B3B2); in doubtful cases, NDVI and DEM were also analyzed to refine the masks; the B2B11B12 composite was used to separate snow. The analysis of the cloud classification errors obtained for our test sites allowed us to get important inferences of general value. The L1C cloud mask generally underestimated the presence of clouds (average Omission Error, OE, 37.4\%); this error increased (OE\,{$>$}\,50\%) for imagery containing opaque clouds with a large transitional zone (between the cloud core and clear areas) and cirrus clouds, fragmentation emerged as a major source of omission errors (R2 0.73). Overestimation was prevalently found in the presence of holes inside the main cloud bodies. Two extreme environments were particularly critical for the L1C cloud mask product. Detection over Amazonian rainforests was highly inefficient (OE\,{$>$}\,70\%) due to the presence of complex cloudiness and high water vapor content. On the other hand, Alpine orography under dry atmosphere created false cirrus clouds. Altogether, cirrus detection was the most inefficient. According to our results, Sentinel-2 L1C users should take some simple precautions while waiting for ESA improved cloud detection products.},

  abstract = {Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential of remote sensing for soil organic carbon (SOC) mapping in exposed croplands. However, the use of remote sensing for SOC prediction is often hindered by disturbing factors at the soil surface, such as photosynthetic active and non-photosynthetic active vegetation, variation in soil moisture or surface roughness. With the increasing amount of freely available satellite data, recent studies have focused on stabilizing the soil reflectance by building image composites. These composites tend to minimize the disturbing effects by applying sets of criteria. Here, we aim to develop a robust method that allows selecting Sentinel-2 (S-2) pixels with minimal influence of the following disturbing factors: crop residues, surface roughness and soil moisture. We selected all S-2 cloud-free images covering the Belgian Loam Belt from January 2019 to December 2020 (in total 36 images). We then built nine exposed soil composites based on four sets of criteria: (1) lowest Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2), (2) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) {$<$} 0.25, (3–5) NDVI {$<$} 0.25 and NBR2 {$<$} threshold, (6) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and (7–9) the ‘greening-up’ period of a crop and NBR2 {$<$} threshold. The ‘greening-up’ period was selected based on the NDVI timeline, where ‘greening-up’ is considered as the last date of acquisition where the soil is exposed (NDVI {$<$} 0.25) before the crop develops (NDVI {$>$} 0.25). We then built a partial least square regression (PLSR) model with 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the SOC content based on 137 georeferenced calibration samples on the nine composites. We obtained non-satisfactory results (R2 {$<$} 0.30, RMSE {$>$} 2.50 g C kg–1, and RPD {$<$} 1.4, n {$>$} 68) for all composites except for the composite in the ‘greening-up’ stage with a NBR2 {$<$} 0.07 (R2 = 0.54 ± 0.12, RPD = 1.68 ± 0.45 and RMSE = 2.09 ± 0.39 g C kg–1, n = 49). Hence, the ‘greening-up’ method combined with a strict NBR2 threshold allows selecting the purest exposed soil pixels suitable for SOC prediction. The limit of this method might be its coverage of the total cropland area, which in a two-year period reached 62\%, compared to 95\% coverage if only the NDVI threshold is applied.},

  abstract = {Vitoria-Gasteiz has taken several urban greening actions such as the introduction of a ring of parks that connect the city’s surroundings, a sustainable mobility plan, and urban green structure strategies. Previous studies establish a connection to the importance of greening to mitigate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and evaluate the effectiveness of these measures on urban climate. In this study, land surface temperature (LST), a remote sensing (RS) parameter, recorded by Landsat satellites (5, 7, and 8) was used to evaluate the effect of SUHI in Vitoria-Gasteiz between 1985–2021. The aim was to evaluate whether the urban greening actions influenced the local thermal conditions and, consequently, helped minimize the SUHI. Thirty sampling locations were identified, corresponding to different local climate zones (LCZ), at which LST data were extracted. A total of 218 images were processed and separated into summer and winter. Four of the 30 locations had, since 2003, on-site meteorological stations with regular air temperature (Tair) measurements which were used to validate the LST data. The results showed that Spearman’s correlation between Tair and LST was higher than 0.88 in all locations. An amount of 21 points maintained the same LCZ classification throughout the analysed period and nine underwent a LCZ transformation. The highest average temperature was identified in the city centre (urbanized area), and the lowest average was in a forest on the outskirts of the city. SUHI was more intense during the summer. A significant increase in SUHI intensity was identified in areas transformed from natural to urban LCZs. However, SUHI during satellite data acquisition periods has shown a minimal change in areas where sustainable practices have been implemented. RS was valuable for analysing the thermal behaviour of the LCZs, despite the limitation inherent in the satellite’s time of passage, in which the SUHI effect is not as evident.},

  abstract = {Over the course of the 21st century, a century in which the urbanization process of the previous one is ever on the rise, the novel smart city concept has rapidly evolved and now encompasses the broader aspect of sustainability. Concurrently, there has been a sea change in the domain of Earth observation (EO) where scientific and technological breakthroughs are accompanied by a paradigm shift in the provision of open and free data. While the urban and EO communities share the end goal of achieving sustainability, cities still lack an understanding of the value EO can bring in this direction, an next a consolidated framework for tapping the full potential of EO and integrating it in their operational modus operandi. The “SMart URBan Solutions for air quality, disasters and city growth” H2020 project (SMURBS/ERA-PLANET) sits at this scientific and policy crossroad, and, by creating bottom-up EO-driven solutions against an array of environmental urban pressures, and by expanding the network of engaged and exemplary smart cities that push the state-of-the-art in EO uptake, brings the international ongoing discussion of EO for sustainable cities closer to home and contributes in this discussion. This paper advocates for EO as an integral part of a smart and sustainable city and aspires to lead by example. To this end, it documents the project’s impacts, ranging from the grander policy fields to an evolving portfolio of smart urban solutions and everyday city operations, as well as the cornerstones for successful EO integration. Drawing a parallel with the utilization of EO in supporting several aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it aspires to be a point of reference for upcoming endeavors of city stakeholders and the EO community alike, to tread together, beyond traditional monitoring or urban planning, and to lay the foundations for urban sustainability.},

Google’s fleet takes the built environment as its territory, renders it photographically, and maps it spatially. GSV’s comprehensive coverage makes it useful for daily navigational needs, and its diverse mapped terrain encourages user innovation, experimentation, and exploration. As a spatial representation, it brings together two distinct ways of knowing the world through empirical documentation: mapping and photography. Whereas maps offer visual diagrams of spatial information, photographs offer documents with spatiotemporal specificity. Together, the spatialized image becomes the mode of navigation and exploration. This article draws on the embodied subject, wayfinding, and perception in relation to spatial knowledge formation to consider GSV’s ability to alter existing daily practices. Rather than the sensorial rich primary experience of moving through the world, the visually rich secondary experiences via GSV come to inform our navigation and exploration through image recognition. This article argues that the platform’s spatialized image and efficient technological layer produces a shift from the embodied experience of place to the image as experience.},

  abstract = {Reflectance composites that capture bare soil pixels from multispectral image data are increasingly being analysed to model soil constituents such as soil organic carbon. These temporal composites are used instead of single-date multispectral images to account for the frequent vegetation cover of soils and, thus, to get broader spatial coverage of bare soil pixels. Most soil compositing techniques require thresholds derived from spectral indices such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalised Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) to separate bare soils from all other land cover types. However, the threshold derivation is handled based on expert knowledge of a specific area, statistical percentile definitions or in situ data. For operational processors, such site-specific and partly manual strategies are not applicable. There is a need for a more generic solution to derive thresholds for large-scale processing without manual intervention. This study presents a novel HIstogram SEparation Threshold (HISET) methodology deriving spectral index thresholds and testing them for a Sentinel-2 temporal data stack. The technique is spectral index-independent, data-driven and can be evaluated based on a quality score. We tested HISET for building six soil reflectance composites (SRC) using NDVI, NBR2 and a new index combining the NDVI and a short-wave infrared (SWIR) band (PV+IR2). A comprehensive analysis of the spectral and spatial performance and accuracy of the resulting SRCs proves the flexibility and validity of HISET. Disturbance effects such as spectral confusion of bare soils with non-photosynthetic-active vegetation (NPV) could be reduced by choosing grassland and crops as input LC for HISET. The NBR2-based SRC spectra showed the highest similarity with LUCAS spectra, the broadest spatial coverage of bare soil pixels and the least number of valid observations per pixel. The spatial coverage of bare soil pixels is validated against the database of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) of the European Commission. Validation results show that PV+IR2-based SRCs outperform the other two indices, especially in spectrally mixed areas of bare soil, photosynthetic-active vegetation and NPV. The NDVI-based SRCs showed the lowest confidence values (95\%) in all bands. In the future, HISET shall be tested in other areas with different environmental conditions and LC characteristics to evaluate if the findings of this study are also valid.},

  abstract = {Cities are growing geographically in response to the enormous increase in urban population; consequently, comprehending growth and environmental changes is critical for long-term planning. Urbanization transforms naturally permeable surfaces into impermeable surfaces, causing an increase in urban land surface temperature, leading to the phenomenon known as urban heat islands. The urban heat islands are noticeable across Malaysia's rural communities and villages, particularly in Kuala Lumpur. These effects must be addressed to slow, if not halt, climate change and meet the Paris Agreement's 2030 goal. The study posits an application of thermal remote sensing utilizing a space-borne satellite-based technique to demonstrate urban evolution for urban heat island analysis and its relationship to land surface temperature. The urban heat island (UHI) was analyzed by converting infrared radiation into visible thermal images utilizing thermal imaging from remote sensing techniques. The heat island is validated by reference to the characteristics of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which define the land surface temperature (LST) of distinct locations. Based on the digital information from the satellite, the highest temperature difference between urban and rural regions for a few chosen cities in 2013 varied from 10.8 to 25.5~°C, while in 2021, it ranged from 16.1 to 26.73~°C, highlighting crucial temperature changes. The results from ANOVA test has substantially strengthened the credibility of the significant temperature changes. Some notable reveals are as follows: The Sungai Batu area, due to its rapid development and industry growth, was more vulnerable to elevated urban heat due to reduced vegetation cover; therefore, higher relative vulnerability. Contrary, the Bukit Ketumbar area, which region lies in the woodland region, experienced the lowest, with urban heat islands reading from 2013~at −0.3044 and 0.0154 in 2021. It shows that despite having urban heat islands increase two-fold from 2013 to 2021, increasing the amount of vegetation coverage is a simple and effective way of reducing the urban heat island effect, as evidenced by the low urban heat islands in the Bukit Ketumbar woodland region. The study findings are critical for advising municipal officials and urban planners to decrease urban heat islands by investing in open green spaces.},

  abstract = {In surveying, mapping and geographic information systems, building extraction from remote sensing imagery is a common task. However, there are still some challenges in automatic building extraction. First, using only single-scale depth features cannot take into account the uncertainty of features such as the hue and texture of buildings in images, and the results are prone to missed detection. Moreover, extracted high-level features often lose structural information and have scale differences with low-level features, which results in less accurate extraction of boundaries. To simultaneously address these problems, we propose pyramid feature extraction (PFE) to construct multi-scale representations of buildings, which is inspired by the feature extraction of scale-invariant feature transform. We also apply attention modules in channel dimension and spatial dimension to PFE and low-level feature maps. Furthermore, we use the structural-cue-guided feature alignment module to learn the correlation between feature maps at different levels, obtaining high-resolution features with strong semantic representation and ensuring the integrity of high-level features in both structural and semantic dimensions. An edge loss is applied to get a highly accurate building boundary. For the WHU Building Dataset, our method achieves an F1 score of 95.3\% and an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 90.9\%; for the Massachusetts Buildings Dataset, our method achieves an F1 score of 85.0\% and an IoU score of 74.1\%.},

  abstract = {The estimation of vegetation parameters, such as above-ground biomass, with high accuracy using remote sensing data, represents a promising approach. The present study develops models to estimate and map above-ground biomass of Mediterranean Quercus rotundifolia stands using one QuickBird satellite image in pan-sharpened mode, with four multispectral bands (blue, green, red and near infrared) and a spatial resolution of 0.70~m. The satellite image was orthorectified, geometrically and radiometrically corrected. Object-oriented classification methods and multi-resolution segmentation were used to derive a vegetation mask per forest species. Data from forest inventory (24 plots) and vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, SR and SAVI) derived from high spatial resolution satellite images were used for an area of 133~km2, in southern Portugal. The statistical analysis included correlation, variance analysis and linear regression. The linear regression models fitted included the arithmetic mean and the median values of the vegetation indices per inventory plot as explanatory variables. The overall results of the fitted models show a trend of better performance for those with the median value of the vegetation index as the explanatory variable. The best fitted model (R2~=~75.3) was associated with the Simple Ratio (SR) median value as an explanatory variable. A Quercus rotundifolia above-ground biomass map was produced.},

  abstract = {The application of machine learning (ML) in a range of geospatial tasks is increasingly common but often relies on globally available covariates such as satellite imagery that can either be expensive or lack predictive power. Here we explore the question of whether the vast amounts of knowledge found in Internet language corpora, now compressed within large language models (LLMs), can be leveraged for geospatial prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that LLMs embed remarkable spatial information about locations, but naively querying LLMs using geographic coordinates alone is ineffective in predicting key indicators like population density. We then present GeoLLM, a novel method that can effectively extract geospatial knowledge from LLMs with auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap. We demonstrate the utility of our approach across multiple tasks of central interest to the international community, including the measurement of population density and economic livelihoods. Across these tasks, our method demonstrates a 70\% improvement in performance (measured using Pearson's \$r\^{}2\$) relative to baselines that use nearest neighbors or use information directly from the prompt, and performance equal to or exceeding satellite-based benchmarks in the literature. With GeoLLM, we observe that GPT-3.5 outperforms Llama 2 and RoBERTa by 19\% and 51\% respectively, suggesting that the performance of our method scales well with the size of the model and its pretraining dataset. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are remarkably sample-efficient, rich in geospatial information, and robust across the globe. Crucially, GeoLLM shows promise in mitigating the limitations of existing geospatial covariates and complementing them well.},

This dataset can support decadal assessments of environmental and land-cover change, production of reflectance-based biophysical products, and applications that merge reflectance data from multiple sensors [e.g., the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)]. The raw imagery was obtained from the orthorectified Landsat GeoCover dataset, purchased by NASA from the Earth Satellite Corporation. Through the LEDAPS project, these data were calibrated, converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance, and then atmospherically corrected using the MODIS/6S methodology. Initial comparisons with ground-based optical thickness measurements and simultaneously acquired MODIS imagery indicate comparable uncertainty in Landsat surface reflectance compared to the standard MODIS reflectance product (the greater of 0.5\% absolute reflectance or 5\% of the recorded reflectance value). The rapid automated nature of the processing stream also paves the way for routine high-level products from future Landsat sensors.},

In Germany, SOC maps are mostly available with a spatial resolution of 250 m to 1 km2. The nationwide availability of both digital elevation models at various spatial resolutions and multi-temporal satellite imagery enables the derivation of multi-scale terrain attributes and (here: Landsat-based) multi-temporal soil reflectance composites (SRC) as explanatory variables. In the example of a Bavarian test of about 8000 km2, relations between 220 SOC content samples as well as different aggregation levels of the explanatory variables were analyzed for their scale-specific predictive power. The aggregation levels were generated by applying a region-growing segmentation procedure, and the SOC content prediction was realized by the Random Forest algorithm. In doing so, established approaches of (geographic) object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) and machine learning were combined. The modeling results revealed scale-specific differences. Compared to terrain attributes, the use of SRC parameters leads to a significant model improvement at field-related scale levels. The joint use of both terrain attributes and SRC parameters resulted in further model improvements. The best modeling variant is characterized by an accuracy of R2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 1.99.},

  abstract = {Mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) at the regional level is critical for climate change policy and the mitigation of its adverse effects. However, reliable SOC estimates particularly over a large extent remains a major challenge due to among others limited sample points, quality of simulation data and the algorithm adopted. Remote sensing (RS) strategies have emerged as a suitable alternative to field and laboratory SOC determination, especially at large spatial extent. The use of Sentinel-3 sensor, the latest of the Sentinel series is minimal and has not been fully developed, despite its impressive attributes that include high spectral-temporal resolution and large coverage. Compared to linear and classical ML models, deep learning (DL) models offer a considerable improvement in data analysis due to their ability to extract more representative features and identify complex spatial patterns associated with big data. Yet, there is paucity in literature on the application of dl-based remote sensing strategies for SOC prediction. Consequently, this study adopted a deep neural network (DNN) to predict SOC at a national scale, using Sentinel-3 image, and compared the results with random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. The models were trained based on 10-fold cross-validation with 1936 soil samples and 31 predictors. The DNN model generated the best result with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.35~t/ha (26~\% of the mean), followed by RF (RMSE~=~11.2~t/ha), ANN (RMSE~=~11.6~t/ha) and SVM (RMSE~=~13.6~t/ha). The analytical prowess of the DNN, together with its ability to handle big data by learning patterns through a series of hidden layers (10) to draw conclusions, gives it an edge over other classical ML models. The study concluded that the DNN model with Sentinel-3 data is promising and provides an effective framework for continuous national level SOC modelling.},

  abstract = {The study and assessment of desertification and/or the advance or retreat of arid areas as a function of natural and anthropogenic causes is necessary for the prediction of future risks from climate change, and to support policymaking, action plans, and mitigation measures that can be taken at local and global scales. Remote sensing enables modelling, monitoring, and prediction of the behaviour of several elements of desertification. There have been numerous approaches to study desertification using remote sensing over the years. This research explored the timeline and global distribution of studies using remote sensing in studying desertification. Additionally, the review evaluated the key methods and variables that have been used to study desertification from remote sensing data. The use of remote sensing for desertification studies can be trace back to 1991. From 2015 to 2020, more than 40 articles were published per year, showing that there has been a recent increase in the use of remote sensing techniques and its availability for monitoring desertification. Most regions of the world affected by desertification are being studied using remote sensing, however, there is a marked geographical variation between the number of studies in various regions, with Asia having disproportionately high number of studies compared to America or Africa. The country with most studies of desertification using remote sensing is China. In terms of satellite data, Landsat images provide the bulk of data used to study desertification, especially the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor. Classification and change detection are the most used methods to study desertification from remote sensing data. Additionally, land cover/land use change and vegetation and its attributes (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI) are the most used variables to study desertification using remote sensing techniques. Finally, the review found major differences in terms of the ranges or thresholds applied to these variables when determining the presence or risk of desertification. Therefore, there is a need to develop thresholds and ranges of changes of key selected variables, which can be used to determine the presence of desertification.},

  abstract = {Multi- and hyperspectral cameras on drones can be valuable tools in environmental monitoring. A significant shortcoming complicating their usage in quantitative remote sensing applications is insufficient robust radiometric calibration methods. In a direct reflectance transformation method, the drone is equipped with a camera and an irradiance sensor, allowing transformation of image pixel values to reflectance factors without ground reference data. This method requires the sensors to be calibrated with higher accuracy than what is usually required by the empirical line method (ELM), but consequently it offers benefits in robustness, ease of operation, and ability to be used on Beyond-Visual Line of Sight flights. The objective of this study was to develop and assess a drone-based workflow for direct reflectance transformation and implement it on our hyperspectral remote sensing system. A novel atmospheric correction method is also introduced, using two reference panels, but, unlike in the ELM, the correction is not directly affected by changes in the illumination. The sensor system consists of a hyperspectral camera (Rikola HSI, by Senop) and an onboard irradiance spectrometer (FGI AIRS), which were both given thorough radiometric calibrations. In laboratory tests and in a flight experiment, the FGI AIRS tilt-corrected irradiances had accuracy better than 1.9\% at solar zenith angles up to 70°. The system's low-altitude reflectance factor accuracy was assessed in a flight experiment using reflectance reference panels, where the normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) were less than ±2\% for the light panels (25\% and 50\%) and less than ±4\% for the dark panels (5\% and 10\%). In the high-altitude images, taken at 100–150 m altitude, the NRMSEs without atmospheric correction were within 1.4\%–8.7\% for VIS bands and 2.0\%–18.5\% for NIR bands. Significant atmospheric effects appeared already at 50 m flight altitude. The proposed atmospheric correction was found to be practical and it decreased the high-altitude NRMSEs to 1.3\%–2.6\% for VIS bands and to 2.3\%–5.3\% for NIR bands. Overall, the workflow was found to be efficient and to provide similar accuracies as the ELM, but providing operational advantages in such challenging scenarios as in forest monitoring, large-scale autonomous mapping tasks, and real-time applications. Tests in varying illumination conditions showed that the reflectance factors of the gravel and vegetation targets varied up to 8\% between sunny and cloudy conditions due to reflectance anisotropy effects, while the direct reflectance workflow had better accuracy. This suggests that the varying illumination conditions have to be further accounted for in drone-based in quantitative remote sensing applications.},

  abstract = {We conducted a systematic review and inventory of recent research achievements related to spaceborne and aerial Earth Observation (EO) data-driven monitoring in support of soil-related strategic goals for a three-year period (2019–2021). Scaling, resolution, data characteristics, and modelling approaches were summarized, after reviewing 46 peer-reviewed articles in international journals. Inherent limitations associated with an EO-based soil mapping approach that hinder its wider adoption were recognized and divided into four categories: (i) area covered and data to be shared; (ii) thresholds for bare soil detection; (iii) soil surface conditions; and (iv) infrastructure capabilities. Accordingly, we tried to redefine the meaning of what is expected in the next years for EO data-driven topsoil monitoring by performing a thorough analysis driven by the upcoming technological waves. The review concludes that the best practices for the advancement of an EO data-driven soil mapping include: (i) a further leverage of recent artificial intelligence techniques to achieve the desired representativeness and reliability; (ii) a continued effort to share harmonized labelled datasets; (iii) data fusion with in situ sensing systems; (iv) a continued effort to overcome the current limitations in terms of sensor resolution and processing limitations of this wealth of EO data; and (v) political and administrative issues (e.g., funding, sustainability). This paper may help to pave the way for further interdisciplinary research and multi-actor coordination activities and to generate EO-based benefits for policy and economy.},

  abstract = {In agronomy, soil organic carbon (SOC) content is important for the development and growth of crops. From an environmental monitoring viewpoint, SOC sequestration is essential for mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. SOC dynamics in cropland soils should be further studied through various approaches including remote sensing. In order to predict SOC content over croplands in southwestern France (area of 22,177 km²), this study addresses (i) the influence of the dates on which Sentinel-2 (S2) images were acquired in the springs of 2017–2018 as well as the influence of the soil sampling period of a set of samples collected between 2005 and 2018, (ii) the use of soil moisture products (SMPs) derived from Sentinel-1/2 satellites to analyze the influence of surface soil moisture on model performance when included as a covariate, and (iii) whether the spatial distribution of SOC as mapped using S2 is related to terrain-derived attributes. The influences of S2 image dates and soil sampling periods were analyzed for bare topsoil. The dates of the S2 images with the best performance (RPD ≥ 1.7) were 6 April and 26 May 2017, using soil samples collected between 2016 and 2018. The soil sampling dates were also analyzed using SMP values. Soil moisture values were extracted for each sample and integrated into partial least squares regression (PLSR) models. The use of soil moisture as a covariate had no effect on the prediction performance of the models; however, SMP values were used to select the driest dates, effectively mapping topsoil organic carbon. S2 was able to predict high SOC contents in the specific soil types located on the old terraces (mesas) shaped by rivers flowing from the southwestern Pyrénées.},

  abstract = {There is a need to update soil maps and monitor soil organic carbon (SOC) in the upper horizons or plough layer for enabling decision support and land management, while complying with several policies, especially those favoring soil carbon storage. This review paper is dedicated to the satellite-based spectral approaches for SOC assessment that have been achieved from several satellite sensors, study scales and geographical contexts in the past decade. Most approaches relying on pure spectral models have been carried out since 2019 and have dealt with temperate croplands in Europe, China and North America at the scale of small regions, of some hundreds of km2: dry combustion and wet oxidation were the analytical determination methods used for 50\% and 35\% of the satellite-derived SOC studies, for which measured topsoil SOC contents mainly referred to mineral soils, typically cambisols and luvisols and to a lesser extent, regosols, leptosols, stagnosols and chernozems, with annual cropping systems with a SOC value of \textasciitilde 15 g·kg−1 and a range of 30 g·kg−1 in median. Most satellite-derived SOC spectral prediction models used limited preprocessing and were based on bare soil pixel retrieval after Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholding. About one third of these models used partial least squares regression (PLSR), while another third used random forest (RF), and the remaining included machine learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM). We did not find any studies either on deep learning methods or on all-performance evaluations and uncertainty analysis of spatial model predictions. Nevertheless, the literature examined here identifies satellite-based spectral information, especially derived under bare soil conditions, as an interesting approach that deserves further investigations. Future research includes considering the simultaneous analysis of imagery acquired at several dates i.e., temporal mosaicking, testing the influence of possible disturbing factors and mitigating their effects fusing mixed models incorporating non-spectral ancillary information.},

  abstract = {Analysis of built-up areas—the most significant artificial urban areas—reveals physical development processes. Unlike previous research involving medium-resolution remote sensing (RS) images, this study used built-up area maps generated from multiple high-resolution RS images with abundant built-up area edge information to analyze development in Zhengzhou. A transferable built-up area extraction (TBUAE) algorithm was developed to map the built-up area maps. The algorithm allows the developed deep learning model used on a certain satellite image to be eligible for other types of satellite images by altering the data distribution with adaptive Wallis filtering (DT-AWF). The proposed method alleviates the pressure of deep learning on the demand for new satellite image samples that are time-consuming and laborious. Additionally, the accuracy of built-up area mapping using this method exceeds 90\%. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted on the map results to observe the urban development of Zhengzhou from 2016 to 2020. We found that Zhengzhou has expanded rapidly since it was defined as a central city in central China in 2016. Additionally, the suburban built-up area has expanded rapidly and developed together with the central city. Further, affected by the policy, the built-up areas in different regions of Zhengzhou has changed differently, the urban edge is more simplified, and the urban internal structure is more compact.},

  abstract = {Desertification is one of the most serious ecological environmental problems over the past several decades in the arid regions. The quantitative assessment of the desertification degree in sandy lands has also been an essential part of landscape ecology. Based on the character of relief, we proposed a new indicator system, i.e., Normalized Landscapes Index (NLI) to calculate the dynamic trend of the desertification process. The data from three periods of Mu Us sandy land and Kubuqi sandy land in Inner Mongolia were used to verify the accuracy of this method. The results show that, from 1990s to 2010s, the NLI change amount of fixed sandy land and semi-fixed sandy land all had positive values while bare sandy land and water had all negative values for both regions. Over the past 20 years, the desertification reversal phenomenon occurs in Mu Us with the desertification process (DP) of −0.36\%, while a positive development of desertification in Kubuqi with the DP of 0.01\%. The NLI dynamic degree of two sandy lands had the same trend as land use dynamic degree, while NLI was more accurate than the landscape dynamic degree. These findings can provide an important method for comparing the desertification process of the desert and also the meaningful information for prevention and control of desertification and sustainable development for the sandy lands in the arid regions.},

  abstract = {For food security issues or global climate change, there is a growing need for large-scale knowledge of soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in agricultural soils. To capture and quantify SOC contents at a field scale, Earth Observation (EO) can be a valuable data source for area-wide mapping. The extraction of exposed soils from EO data is challenging due to temporal or permanent vegetation cover, the influence of soil moisture or the condition of the soil surface. Compositing techniques of multitemporal satellite images provide an alternative to retrieve exposed soils and to produce a data source. The repeatable soil composites, containing averaged exposed soil areas over several years, are relatively independent from seasonal soil moisture and surface conditions and provide a new EO-based data source that can be used to estimate SOC contents over large geographical areas with a high spatial resolution. Here, we applied the Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) to the Landsat archive between 1984 and 2014 of images covering Bavaria, Germany. Compared to existing SOC modeling approaches based on single scenes, the 30-year SCMaP soil reflectance composite (SRC) with a spatial resolution of 30 m is used. The SRC spectral information is correlated with point soil data using different machine learning algorithms to estimate the SOC contents in cropland topsoils of Bavaria. We developed a pre-processing technique to address the issue of combining point information with EO pixels for the purpose of modeling. We applied different modeling methods often used in EO soil studies to choose the best SOC prediction model. Based on the model accuracies and performances, the Random Forest (RF) showed the best capabilities to predict the SOC contents in Bavaria (R² = 0.67, RMSE = 1.24\%, RPD = 1.77, CCC = 0.78). We further validated the model results with an independent dataset. The comparison between the measured and predicted SOC contents showed a mean difference of 0.11\% SOC using the best RF model. The SCMaP SRC is a promising approach to predict the spatial SOC distribution over large geographical extents with a high spatial resolution (30 m).},
