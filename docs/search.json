    "text": "2.1 Summary:\nImagine sophisticated sensors mounted on these celestial companions, each like a specialized listener collecting whispers from the Earth below. Some passively listen to sunlight reflected off our planet’s surface, while others actively send their own signals and capture the echoes. These sensors interpret a fascinating language of light, both invisible and visible, known as the electromagnetic spectrum. Different materials sing unique tunes in this spectrum, allowing us to identify them - it’s like having a scientific decoder ring for Earth’s secrets!\nBut information isn’t just about color. Remote sensing data has its own “resolution” recipe, encompassing:\n\nSpectral: How many “voices” the sensor can hear, revealing more detail with each additional band.\nSpatial: The size of each pixel in the image, ranging from centimeters to kilometers, offering varying levels of detail.\nTemporal: How often the sensor revisits the same area, providing a dynamic view of changes over time.\nRadiometric: The range of brightness levels captured, painting a vibrant and accurate picture.\n\nThese resolutions work together, creating a nuanced and informative snapshot of our planet."

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nRemote Sensing has many transformative applications in the realm of Urban Analytics. Think of it as an X-ray for cities, revealing hidden patterns and empowering informed decision-making by city planners, urban designers, and public officials to make swift and informed decisions to improve the lives of millions of urbanites.\nHere are some examples\n\nMapping Urban Growth: By tracking changes in the built environment over time, we can identify sprawling suburbs, monitor urban expansion, and plan for infrastructure needs.\n\nPredicting Floods with Foresight: Analysing land cover and terrain, it anticipates where water will flow, safeguarding communities from harm.\n\nEnergy Efficiency: Identifying heat island effects and understanding building energy consumption through thermal imaging empowers planners to design sustainable cities\n\n\nThis is just the beginning. Remote sensing is transforming the way we understand and manage our cities, paving the way for a healthier, smarter, and more sustainable urban future."

Credit: NASA Science\n\n\nElectromagnetic radiation moves as waves as perpendicular electric and magnetic field with a wavelength: λ = c/v where:\n\nλ = wavelength, distance between two crests\nc = velocity of light 3 x 108 m/sec\nv = frequency, rate of oscillation (full oscillations in a time unit)\n\nDifferent materials reflect unique wavelengths in this spectrum, allowing us to identify them, like decoding DNA! More on this later…\n\n\n\nWavelength vs. Oscillation\n\n\nBut information that sensors receive isn’t just about color. Remote sensing data has its own “resolution” recipe, encompassing:\n\nSpectral: How EMS bands (i.e., the range within the EMS) the sensor can hear, revealing more detail with each additional band.\nSpatial: The size of each pixel in the image, ranging from centimeters to kilometers, offering varying levels of detail.\nTemporal: How often the sensor revisits the same area, providing a dynamic view of changes over time.\nRadiometric: The range of brightness levels captured, painting a vibrant and accurate picture.\n\nIn reality, depending on the purpose, each sensor is equip to have better resolution of one type over the other. For example, sensors with a high spatial resolution of 5m (i.e., each pixel is 10x10 on the ground) will have lower spectral resolution (i.e., capturing only narrow range of the EMS) (“Remote Sensing, Satellite Imaging Technology | Satellite Imaging Corp” n.d.)"
