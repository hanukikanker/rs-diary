Most recently, though, I can be found looking at maps and thrift-shopping in London.\nI am an economist by training with a long subsequent stint in the Tech industry. While on the job, I was fascinated by the power of “Big Data” and the cloud. Marrying that with the love for maps and earth observation, I embarked on this journey into Remote Sensing. Come on in.\nI also love talking about (and in) foreign languages I know and am learning. Say hi to me in Vietnamese, English, Spanish, and Italian. Currently working on German and Mandarin.\n\n\nSince you’re still reading…\nGet in touch with me over email or LinkedIn."

    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote Sensing uses satellites, planes, drones, etc., as our aerial eyes, piecing together a portrait of our planet through light and data and revolutionising how we understand and interact with it.\nSensors, well, ‘sense’ Earth in two ways: Some passively listen to sunlight reflected off our planet’s surface (i.e., passive sensors), while others actively send their own signals and capture the echoes (i.e., active sensors). By that definition, the human eye is a type of passive sensors!\n\n\n\nActive vs Passive Remote Sensing (Earth Science Data Systems 2019).\n\n\nThese sensors interpret a fascinating language of light, both invisible and visible, known as the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n\n\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS). Credit: NASA Science\n\n\nElectromagnetic radiation moves as waves as perpendicular electric and magnetic field with a wavelength: λ = c/v where:\n\nλ = wavelength, the distance between two crests\nc = velocity of light 3 x 108 m/sec\nv = frequency, rate of oscillation (full oscillations in a time unit)\n\nDifferent materials reflect unique wavelengths in this spectrum, allowing us to identify them, like decoding DNA!\n\n\n\nWavelength vs. Oscillation\n\n\nBut the information that sensors receive isn’t just about colour. Remote sensing data has its own “resolution” recipe, encompassing:\n\nSpectral: How EMS bands (i.e., the range within the EMS) the sensor can hear, revealing more detail with each additional band.\nSpatial: The size of each pixel in the image, ranging from centimetres to kilometres, offers varying detail levels.\nTemporal: How often the sensor revisits the same area, providing a dynamic view of changes over time.\nRadiometric: The range of brightness levels captured, painting a vibrant and accurate picture.\n\nDepending on the purpose, each sensor is equipped to have better resolution of one type over the other. For example, sensors with a high spatial resolution of 5m (i.e., each pixel is 10x10 on the ground) will have a lower spectral resolution (i.e., capturing only a narrow range of the EMS) (“Remote Sensing, Satellite Imaging Technology | Satellite Imaging Corp” n.d.)"

Think of it as an X-ray for cities, revealing hidden patterns and empowering informed decision-making by city planners, urban designers, and public officials to make swift and informed decisions to improve the lives of millions of urbanites.\nHere are some examples of the use of Remote Sensing in urban analytics research\n\nMapping Urban Growth: By tracking changes in the built environment over time, we can identify sprawling suburbs, monitor urban expansion, and plan for infrastructure needs. Recent works have used a diverse source of high-resolution Remote Sensing data (2m) to train a machine-learning model to extract ‘urbanised’ areas more robustly compared to a previous methodology using only medium-resolution images. (Wang et al. 2021)\n\n\n\n\nTransferable built-up area extraction (TBUAE) framework to map urbanised areas\n\n\n\nPredicting Floods with Foresight: Analysing land cover and terrain, it anticipates where water will flow, safeguarding communities from harm while also estimating potential damage. This type of risk assessment is highly relevant not only in climate science and the public sector but also among insurance companies who make use of SAR satellite data (for through-cloud vision) combined with other spatial data sets to assess risk and process claims (Schumann et al. 2023)\n\n\n\n\nRemote sensing data can be used to estimate flood extent and to derive individual risk level damage estimates.\n\n\n\nEnergy Efficiency: Identifying heat island effects and understanding building energy consumption through thermal imaging empowers planners to design sustainable cities and researchers. Remote Sensing data is a key component in Urban Climate Models such as UrbCLIM by VITO, a Belgian research organisation, which aims to create an interactive tool providing high-resolution urban heat maps and predict their evolution under future climate conditions.

For the uninitiated, it is easy to assume that remote sensing purely means orthophotography satellite images that one might see using platforms such as Google Maps, i.e. as if the only thing that sensors do were to snap a simple photo of the planet like a phone camera.\nIn reality, it unlocks unseen depths of data beyond mere human perception, not just high-resolution photographs and more spectral signatures, where each pixel holds a universe of information. Building a true-colour composite from all these layers (so that our limited human vision can perceive them) was like seeing the world through a brand-new lens.\nI am particularly excited to get started with Google Earth Engine later on as the primary gateway to access the wealth of remote sensing data and analytics with more ease to solve specific problems facing our world today.\n\n\n\n\n“DestinE for Human Heat Stress: ECMWF Use Case to Tackle Urban Heat Islands.” n.d.

    "section": "3.1 Summary",
    "text": "3.1 Summary\nRaw data from sensors are rarely immediately usable without being corrected for various interferences and effects. Common correction methods are geometric and topographic corrections and radiometric and atmospheric corrections. Finally, enhancement methods help us highlight values of interest that pertain to our research scope.\n\n3.1.1 Radiometric and Atmospheric corrections\nThese processes describe translating raw light data from the sensor into ‘true’ information on the surface’s reflectance property without interference from the light source and the atmosphere.\n\nRadiometric calibration is the conversion from raw Digital Number (raw, no units) to Spectral Radiance via a linear transformation \\(L_λ=Bias+(Gain∗DN)\\). Radiance most often has units of watt/(steradian/square meter)\nAtmospheric correction is the next step:\n\nTOA Radiance-to-Reflectance correction removes the effects of the light source (e.g. the sun) by calibrating radiation going down (irradiance) and up (radiance). TOA Reflectance still affects the atmosphere and the surface material. If irradiance is equal to radiance, we call this hemispheric reflectance.\nTOA-to-BOA Reflectance correction removes the effects of the atmospheric conditions, leaving us with just data on the surface materials. If shadows and directional effects on reflectance have been dealt with, we get what is called true reflectance; if not, it is called apparent reflectance.\n\n\nAtmospheric correction deserves our attention, considering the effect of atmospheric scattering on the final results. Absorption and scattering create the haze, which reduces the contrast and can create the “adjacency effect”, whereby radiance from pixels nearby is mixed into pixels of interest. Atmospheric correction to obtain actual reflectance is not always necessary, for example, for classifying a single image, working on composite images, etc. There are two types of atmospheric correction: -\n\nRelative: normalise intensities of different bands within a single image or from many dates to one date. This can be done via Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) or Pseudo-invariant Features (PIFs).\nAbsolute: change digital brightness values into scaled surface reflectance. We can then compare these scaled surface reflectance values across the planet through atmospheric radiative transfer models (i.e. summer, tropical) or Empirical Line Correction.\n\n\n\n\nExample of LEDAPS atmospheric correction. (a) Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance composite (bands 3,2,1) for Landsat-7 ETM+ image of San Francisco Bay (July 7, 1999); (b) Surface reflectance composite.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Geometric and topographic corrections\nThese are subsets of Georectification, which gives coordinates to an image and accounts for view angle, topography, wind disturbance, Earth rotation, etc., distorting the resultant image’s geometry.\nTopographic correction corrects the view angle of the image so that it is nadir (i.e., directly top-down). Important concepts to get familiar with for orthorectification are:\n\nSolar azimuth: compass angle of the sun (N =0°) 90° (E) at sunrise and 270° (W) at sunset.\nSolar zenith: angle of local zenith (above the point on the ground) and sun from vertical (90° - elevation)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometric correction effectively ‘grounds’ the images into a georeferenced final product (i.e., with a coordinate). We identify Ground Control Points (GPS) to match known points in the image and a reference dataset. We then model the coordinates to give geometric transformation coefficients (linear regression). It effectively resembles fitting old maps into a digital version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Joining and Enhancements\nTo join (i.e., ‘mosaicking’), within the overlap area (20-30%), a representative sample is taken, a histogram is extracted from the base image, which is then applied to other images using a histogram matching algorithm to blend the brightness values of the two images (‘feathering’)\nFinally, after all the corrections, there are still many enhancements that can improve or accentuate the visual results depending on the purpose of the research:\n\nContrast enhancement to accentuate reflectance values that are close to each other\nRatio calculation calculates pixel value as a ratio of different bands (e.g. Normalised Burn Ratio)\nFiltering is the use of low-pass filters that average (i.e., smooth) the data or high-pass filters that enhance the variances between features. Filtering is used to perform texture and edge detection.\nPCA transforms multi-spectral data into uncorrelated datasets. Multi-date overlay PCA is a way to detect change efficiently.\nFusion entails fusing images/data from multiple sensors to improve details, enable better classification, or downsample."

    "text": "3.2 Application\nDespite having delved a lot into corrections, it is worth noting that standard remote sensing products now come corrected (Level-2, or “Analysis Ready Data”, ARD). In contrast, products derived from corrected ones are called Level-3. Research that works directly with Level-1 products often seeks to refine the correction methodology to transform them into ARDs (Coluzzi et al. 2018)\nEnhancements made to ARD (i.e. Level-3 products) represent a proliferating field to survey, thanks to its wealth of innovative applications of a single or combinations of techniques, depending on the task at hand. According to recent research that made use of remote sensing data, there seem to be two main umbrella objectives researchers have when considering which enhancement methods to employ:\n\nVisualisation: Visual enhancement essentially accentuates the desired subject vs. other details. Contrast stretching to make images appear brighter is often done without much fanfare but is an essential step in using remote sensing data as an artefact perceptible in print to the human eyes. However, image enhancement using band ratio is widely used to highlight certain objects, with indices including NDVI, SAVI, etc., for Vegetation or NDWI, SWI, etc., for Water and Snow. A combination of indices can also be used to produce a composite ratio that can best visualise the desired study area, which was how Macedo et al. (2018) was able to map the holm oak above-ground biomass over a large area with different atmospheric conditions.\nFeature extraction: Many researchers seek to extract novel datasets from remote sensing data for various purposes, including training machine learning models to do the same (and better) for a larger region or globally. This objective is related to but ultimately distinguished from the above because the output is not a cartographic product but a dataset. The main difficulty when tackling this is to classify accurately (avoid false negatives and positives) while retaining the depth of information in each pixel. Li et al. (2022) proposed a pyramid feature extraction (PFE) to construct multi-scale representations of buildings, in which convolutional neural networks were applied on satellite images already gone through a combination of edge and texture detection, which were then again applied to subsequent output in the workflow."

The vast amount of information obtainable from raw multi-spectral data is impressive and somewhat little-appreciated outside of the geospatial community.\nTherefore, democratising remote sensing data and technological advancements will empower research on Earth’s surface, surpassing local data collection, which is uneven and ununified by nature. Instead, remote sensing can be performed globally if the correct adjustments for the atmosphere and enhancements to fit the objectives are made.\nHowever, while this is an untapped data source, there are two hurdles to overcome before they may be fully utilised.\n\nTechnical competence: Remote sensing is jargon-filled, with each discipline adopting its best practice to harness the data, making the barrier to entry higher than that of other types of data analysis work. Standardisation of industry-agnostic workflow and training may be vital to upskilling geospatial analysts to work more natively with remote sensing data.\nHigh-resolution EO data are mostly not free and reserved for governmental/military use. High-quality EO data (multispectral, high spatial resolution, frequent, etc.) also depends on localities.

    "text": "4.1 Summary\nThe amount of carbon in the atmosphere has increased by 30% in the past two centuries from high levels of fossil fuel combustion and deforestation, leading to rising global temperatures.\nAmong many well-known strategies to reduce our carbon footprints, such as developing energy-efficient fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, there are also strategies such as soil carbon sequestration, tree planting, and ocean carbon sequestration.\nHow carbon is captured within soil:\n\nPlants capture carbon through photosynthesis, and some remain as plant tissue. Dead plant tissue enters the soil as litter and decomposes.\nDecomposition creates soil organic matter (SOM), the main carbon stored in soil. SOM can hold carbon for a long time or release it back into the atmosphere.\nVarious factors like climate, vegetation, texture, and drainage influence carbon storage.\n\nDirect human intervention (on-farm activities) could also enhance soil carbon sequestration.\n\n\n\nOn-farm activities to enhance soil carbon sequestration (Barbato and Strong 2023)\n\n\nGlobally, there are policies in place to incentivise farmers to undertake on-farm activities that sequester soil carbon.\nFor example, in California’s Cap-and-Trade Program, the private sector can buy carbon credits for their offset targets. Downstream, rice farmers, for instance, may volunteer to implement one of three methods included in the protocol to sequester carbon: dry seeding, early drainage, or alternative wetting or drying at the price per ton CO2e was $7. (“Carbon Farming: Opportunities for Agriculture and Farmers to Gain From Decarbonization” n.d.)\nAdoption challenges for these markets include (1) ensuring accurate carbon measurement and (2) verifying “additionality” - that carbon sequestration wouldn’t have happened without the market incentive. Between the two main challenges, Remote Sensing technology has the most potential in tackling the first at scale, rather than relying on local field work that is labour-intensive and limited by nature, albeit more precise."

    "text": "4.2 Application\n\n4.2.1 From academia…\nThere has only been a recently increasing academic focus on the application of Remote Sensing and Earth Observation technologies to map and Monitor Soil Organic Carbon, with much credit to the free and open availability of satellite imagery, such as that of Sentinel missions, facilitated by the Copernicus program. Here are some notable works in this realm and their significance to the state-of-the-art:\nTziolas et al. (2021) is a formative article that provided insights into the usage of AI techniques and other data pipeline rigour and innovations to increase resolutions and better harness EO data. In the article, they aptly pointed out that ‘an EO data-driven approach should be prioritized if progress towards the soil policy and economic strategic goals is to be accelerated’ which reveals the current disconnect between academia and actual adoption of this technology, perhaps due to non-standardised SOC monitoring methodology and a lack of focus on the end-user experience.\nIndeed, a further review of current literature showcases the vast complexity that analysts must contend with in order to reliably measure SOC. For example, van Wesemael et al. (2023) highlighted the need for bare soil conditions and recommended temporal mosaicking to remove irrelevant spectral variations to arrive at a robust SOC prediction model. Upon that conclusion, other researchers delved deeper into diverging techniques to extract bare soil pixels from Sentinel and Landsat data.\n\nUrbina-Salazar et al. (2021) showed that Sentinel 1/2 soil moisture products were helpful in extracting bare and dry soil pixels\nZepp et al. (2021) used multitemporal (30+ years) satellite images as an alternative to retrieve exposed soils from a soil reflectance composite\nDvorakova, Heiden, and van Wesemael (2021) instead focused on a particular period based on a time series of normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), and concluded that the best SOC prediction could already be achieved for this particular period by using a strict normalised burn ratio 2 (NBR2) threshold.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Sentinel-2 Images for Soil Organic Carbon Content Mapping in Croplands (Urbina-Salazar et al. 2021)\n\n\nOther works focused on improving the prediction model further with higher spatial resolution input data to correspond with average field size (Möller et al. 2022), and techniques to overcome vegetation cover (Heiden et al. 2022)\nOn the other hand, depth matters when it comes to SOC mapping (“Depth Matters for Soil Carbon Accounting – CarbonPlan” n.d.), with best practices requiring soil sampling that encompasses the full crop-rooting zone of a minimum of 30 cm. Therefore, 3D mapping is another frontier where many innovations have emerged. The pseudo-3D technique is the building of separate models for individual depth intervals, whose interval predictions are integrated to get the full profile of SOC.\n\n\n4.2.2 …to the public\nThe first Global Soil Organic Matter map was launched on World Soil Day in 2017), by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). The map is produced on a common grid for 100 countries, allowing scientists and policymakers to identify degraded areas and explore the potential for soils to capture soil carbon. The map also helps set restoration targets, support the greenhouse gas emission reporting under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and make evidence-based decisions to mitigate and adapt.

At the national level, such data can be used as reference soil carbon stocks, with the aim of refining national greenhouse gas inventories and assessing the sensitivity of soils to degradation and climate change.\nThat said, scant evidence has been found to show further applications using the GSOC map, or Level-3 EO SOC mapping products, either at the national level at finer spatial resolution or by the private or public sector, as an active component to incentivise stakeholders to take action. In most cases, what GSP was able to produce was a series of guidelines for national stakeholders without imposing shared deliverables and timelines. Instead, the original GSOC maps are used to determine the status quo and rally political interest at the national level and do not possess the spatial resolution needed to make them effective monitoring tools.\nPossible reasons may lie in technical competency to effectively produce national soil maps with the right open data policy to allow the public and other innovators to tap into this data.\n\n\n\n\nBarbato, Clare T., and Aaron L.
